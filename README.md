# ZSH!

Guys, zsh is great. 

these are my setup files. 

Inspirational credit will always go to [@qrohlf](https://www.github.com/qrohlf) and his wizard magic. I've stolen the autoload idea from him (and others). 

Other than that, the rest is me. 

## Usage

add a .zshrc file to your home directory with the following contents
```
export ZSH='full/path/to/this/repo'
source "$ZSH/init.zsh"
```

Dont use this to be mean. I get to decide what that means.
